\exercise{1}
Define $\zeta = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}2 \in \C$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $\zeta$ is a primitive third root of unity.
    \item Show that the norm (for the field extension $\Q(\zeta)/\Q$ of
        an element $x + y\zeta \in \Q(\zeta)$, where $x,y \in \Q$, is given by
        $x^2 - xy + y^2$, and that this is non-negative for all $x,y \in \Q$. 
    \item  Following the discussion of $\Z[i]$ from the lecture, show that a prime
        $p \neq 3$ is of the form $p = x^2 - xy + y^2$ for some $x,y \in \Z$ if
        and only if $p \equiv 1$ (mod $3$). 
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $A$ be a principal ideal domain that is not a field, and let $\fm
        \subset A$ be a maximal ideal. Prove that $\fm^n/\fm^{n+1}$ is a
        one-dimensional vector space over $A/\fm$ for any $n \geq 0$. 
    \item Let $A = \C[x,y]$ and $\fm = (x,y)$. Compute $\dim_{A/\fm} (\fm^n
        /\fm^{n+1})$ for $n \geq 0$. Deduce that $A$ is not a principal ideal
        domain. 
    \item Let $A = \Z[\sqrt{-3}]$. Show that $A$ has a unique maximal ideal $\fm$
        with $\fm \cap \Z = (2)$. Compute $\dim_{A/\fm} \fm/\fm^2$. Deduce that 
        $A$ is not a principal ideal domain.
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{3}
Let $A$ be a unique factorization domain. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that for any prime element $\pi \in A$, the ideal $\fp = (\pi)$ is 
        prime and only contains the prime ideals $\{0\}$ and $\fp$.
    \item Conversely, let $0 \neq \fp \subset A$ be a prime ideal such that $\{0\}$
        and $\fp$ are the only prime ideals of $A$ that are contained in $\fp$. 
        Show that $\fp = (\pi)$ for some prime element $\pi \in A$. 
    \item Assume that each non-zero prime ideal $\fp \subset A$ satisfies the
        assumption in 2). Show that $A$ is a principal ideal domain. 
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{4}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $A$ be any ring. Show that $A$ contains minimal prime ideals. 
    \item Determine the minimal prime ideals of $\Z[x,y]/(xy)$.
